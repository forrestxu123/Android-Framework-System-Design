## 1 Android Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

IPC mechanisms involve the communication of one process with another process. In Linux, various IPC mechanisms are available, including the tranditional IPC mechanisms such as Pipes, FIFO, Message Queues, Unix Domain Sockets, Shared Memory, Semaphores, and Signals. These mechanisms offer valuable means of communication between processes; however, they come with certain limitations:

- **Functionality:**
    The tranditional IPC mechanisms are primarily designed for communication between processes. However, they are not specialized for method calls with Object-Oriented parameters within the same machine.
  
- **Security:**
    - *Fine-Grained Security Controls: The tranditional IPC mechanisms lack fine-grained security controls, making it challenging to regulate access to shared resources.
    - *Access Regulation: The tranditional IPC mechanisms may not provide effective mechanisms to regulate which processes can access shared resources, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
    - *Permissions Management:* The tranditional IPC mechanisms may not manage permissions effectively, raising concerns about data security and unauthorized access.

Security issues may lead to data leakage or deadlock. For preinstalled apps or daemons, a viable solution is to utilize SELinux, ensuring that specific apps can access designated IPC mechanisms, safeguarding app data. However, for regular apps running in an untrusted app domain, SELinux may face limitations in distinguishing between them.

To address these challenges, the Android system provides the Binder IPC mechanism. We will introduce widely used IPC mechanisms in Android, including Unix Sockets, Shared Memory, and Binder IPC.

### 1.1 SharedMemory
Shared memory facilitates direct data sharing between the local processes without the overhead of copying. It offers low-latency, high-performance communication, making it suitable for scenarios involving frequent and large data transfers. The memory-mapped nature of shared memory simplifies data manipulation and enhances memory efficiency, allowing processes to access shared data as if it were regular memory. To ensure proper concurrency and prevent race conditions when accessing shared memory, synchronization mechanisms like semaphores are required. 

#### 1.1.1 Shared Memory Design Diagram
The shared memory has the following lifecycle:
- Processes in user space use the mmap system call to map a portion of virtual memory into their respective address spaces, creating a shared memory region.
- When a process calls mmap, the /dev/ashmem driver, acting as an intermediary between user space and the kernel, facilitates communication with the kernel's memory management system.
- The kernel's memory management system interacts with the page table to map the requested virtual memory region to physical memory, ensuring accessibility for the processes. 
- With the memory successfully mapped, processes can read from or write to the shared memory region. Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores may be employed to coordinate access.
- When processes are done with the shared memory, they use the munmap system call to unmap the memory.
- During the memory mapping process, the page table is updated to reflect the mapping of virtual memory to physical memory, ensuring proper address translation for subsequent access.

#### 1.1.2 Shared Memory example code
See example code for creating and accessing shared memory with semaphores based synchronization mechanisms support below:

Program A

```c
#define SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE 1024
#define SEMAPHORE_NAME "/my_semaphore"
int main() {
    int fd;
    void *shared_memory;
    sem_t *semaphore;
    // Open the /dev/ashmem device file
    fd = open("/dev/ashmem", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Error opening /dev/ashmem");
        return 1;
    }
    // Set the size of the shared memory region
    ioctl(fd, ASHMEM_SET_SIZE, SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE);
    // Map the shared memory region into the process address space
    shared_memory = mmap(NULL, SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    // Create or open the semaphore
    semaphore = sem_open(SEMAPHORE_NAME, O_CREAT, 0666, 1);
    if (semaphore == SEM_FAILED) {
        perror("Error creating/opening semaphore");
        return 1;
    }
    // Write data to shared memory
    strcpy((char *)shared_memory, "Hello, Shared Memory!");
    // Post the semaphore to signal completion of writing
    sem_post(semaphore);
    // Clean up
    munmap(shared_memory, SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE);
    close(fd);
    sem_close(semaphore);
    return 0;
}
```

Program B

```c
#define SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE 1024
#define SEMAPHORE_NAME "/my_semaphore"

int main() {
    int fd;
    void *shared_memory;
    sem_t *semaphore;
    // Open the /dev/ashmem device file
    fd = open("/dev/ashmem", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Error opening /dev/ashmem");
        return 1;
    }
    // Map the shared memory region into the process address space
    shared_memory = mmap(NULL, SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    // Create or open the semaphore
    semaphore = sem_open(SEMAPHORE_NAME, O_CREAT, 0666, 1);
    if (semaphore == SEM_FAILED) {
        perror("Error creating/opening semaphore");
        return 1;
    }
    // Wait on the semaphore before reading from shared memory
    sem_wait(semaphore);
    // Read and print data from shared memory
    printf("Reader process read from shared memory: %s\n", (char *)shared_memory);
    // Clean up
    munmap(shared_memory, SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE);
    close(fd);
    sem_close(semaphore);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, Program A writes to shared memory, and Program B reads from shared memory. Both programs use semaphores for synchronization.

### 1.2 Unix Domain Socket(UDS)
UDS facilitate efficient and bidirectional communication between the local processes. UDS supports zero-copy mechanisms,  reducing data duplication copy during exchange. DS offer a secure data access protection through access modes that define permissions.
Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) play a crucial role in the Android system. For instance, Android utilizes BitTube mechanism whcih is based on UDS to transmit VSYNC information from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to SurfaceFlinger.

#### 1.2.1 UDS Design Diagram
In the Unix Domain Socket (UDS) design diagram below, the workflow includes the following steps:
   - Socket Creation: Use socket() to create a socket.
   - Binding: Use bind() to associate the socket with a specific local address or file name.
   - Listening: Call listen() to transition the socket into the listening state, allowing it to accept incoming connections.
   - Accept: Call accept() to create an incoming connection on a listening socket, obtaining a new file descriptor. Synchronize with the client to ensure both server and client file descriptors point to the same file description in the open file description table.
   - Connection Establishment: Call connect() to establish a connection with the server. Synchronize with the server to make its file descriptor point to the same file description in the open file description table.
   - Data Transfer: Use send() and recv() for communication. The file descriptors in both client and server point to the same file description in the open file description table, facilitating zero-copy operations.
   - Socket Closure: Call close() to remove entries from the process FD table and the system open FD table.
This workflow ensures a seamless and synchronized interaction between the server and client, leveraging the shared file descriptions for efficient data transfer and maintaining proper cleanup procedures during socket closure.

#### 1.2.2 UDS Sample Code
Server Program

```c

#define SOCKET_PATH "/tmp/example_socket"
void error(const char *msg) {
    perror(msg);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
int main() {
      /*Create a Unix domain socket
       SOCK_SEQPACKET is a socket type that provides a reliable, connection-oriented, and sequenced
      communication channel. It preserves message boundaries and delivers data as a sequence of
       complete packets.*/
    int sockfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
    if (sockfd == -1) {
        error("Error creating socket");
    }
    struct sockaddr_un addr;
    addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
    strncpy(addr.sun_path, SOCKET_PATH, sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 1);
    // Bind the socket to a file path
    if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(addr)) == -1) {
        error("Error binding socket");
    }
    // Listen for connections
    if (listen(sockfd, 5) == -1) {
        error("Error listening for connections");
    }
    printf("Server is listening on %s\n", SOCKET_PATH);
    while (1) {
        // Accept incoming connections
        int clientfd = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);
        if (clientfd == -1) {
            error("Error accepting connection");
        }
        printf("Received a connection from a client\n");
        // Send multiple messages to the client
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i) {
            char message[20];
            snprintf(message, sizeof(message), "Message %d", i);
            // Send the message
            if (send(clientfd, message, sizeof(message), 0) == -1) {
                error("Error sending message");
            }
            printf("Sent: %s\n", message);
        }
        // Close the connection
        close(clientfd);
        printf("Connection closed\n");
    }
    // Close the server socket
    close(sockfd);
    // Remove the socket file
    unlink(SOCKET_PATH);
    return 0;
}
```
Client Program

```c

#define SOCKET_PATH "/tmp/example_socket"
void error(const char *msg) {
    perror(msg);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
int main() {
    // Create a Unix domain socket
    int sockfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
    if (sockfd == -1) {
        error("Error creating socket");
    }
    struct sockaddr_un addr;
    addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
    strncpy(addr.sun_path, SOCKET_PATH, sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 1);
    // Connect to the server
    if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(addr)) == -1) {
        error("Error connecting to the server");
    }
    printf("Connected to the server\n");
    // Receive messages from the server
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i) {
        char message[20];
        ssize_t bytesRead = recv(sockfd, message, sizeof(message), 0);
        if (bytesRead == -1) {
            error("Error receiving message");
        } else if (bytesRead == 0) {
            printf("Server closed the connection\n");
            break;
        } else {
            printf("Received: %s\n", message);
        }
    }
    // Close the client socket
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;

### 1.3 Binder IPC
Binder IPC is a key mechanism in the Android system, enabling efficient communication among different components. It overcomes limitations found in traditional IPC methods, focusing on shared memory support, security access control, and method calls with Object-Oriented parameters. In the Android system, The Binder IPC allows seamless exchange of data and messages between applications, system services, and the HAL layer, ensuring optimal resource utilization. With its integral role in Android's architecture, a solid understanding of Binder IPC is essential for developers to craft robust and high-performance applications.
#### 1.3.1 Binder IPC Design Diagram
This design diagram below outlines the key steps involved in Binder IPC with a System Service, highlighting the interactions between different components. The workflow includes:
 - Define Binder Interface:
Define the Binder interface through an AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) file, specifying the methods that will be remotely accessible.

 - Implement Binder Interface:
Implement the Binder interface in the System Service Stub, providing the concrete implementation for each method defined in the interface.

 - Register with Service Manager:
Register the System Service with the Service Manager by calling ServiceManager.addService(service) as soon as the System Server is launched. This step allows clients to discover and access the System Service.
 - Allocate Shared Memory for Binder IPC:
Allocate approximately 1 megabyte of shared memory for Binder IPC. This shared memory facilitates efficient data exchange between the client app and the System Service.

 - Client App Interaction:
The client app calls ServiceManager.getService() to obtain an instance of the System Service, allowing access to its remote functions.

- Remote Function Invocation:
Utilize the System Service instance in the client app to invoke remote functions defined in the Binder interface. This initiates the communication between the client app and the System Service.
 - Data Serialization:
Serialize the data related to the method call in the client app. This serialized data is then placed into the shared memory allocated for Binder IPC.
 - /dev/binder Driver Interaction:
The /dev/binder driver, a key component of Binder IPC, maps a portion of the System Server's memory to the shared memory in the client app. This mapping facilitates efficient data transfer.
 - Call Method in System Service:
Upon completing its tasks, the /dev/binder driver triggers the onTransaction() method in the System Service. This method handles deserialization, selects a thread from the thread pool, and calls the corresponding function requested by the client app.
This comprehensive workflow ensures seamless and efficient communication between the client app and the System Service using Binder IPC, leveraging shared memory and the essential components of the Binder framework. See design diagram below for more detail:
   
<img src="binderipc.png" alt="Binder IPC tArchitecture"/>

#### 1.3.2 Binder IPC Sample Code:
In Section 1.3.1, we focused on system service discussion. For application service, the logic is similar to the system service. However, we use bindService() and onConnection() mechanisms to find the service, rather than ServiceManager used by the system service. To see example code on how a client interacts with the application service, refer to the code snippet below:

 - AIDL interface (IRemoteService.aidl):

```c

interface IRemoteService {
    void sendMessage(String message);
}
```

 - Tthe Application Service (RemoteService.java):

```c
public class RemoteService extends Service {
    
    private final IBinder binder = new RemoteBinder();

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return binder;
    }

    public class RemoteBinder extends Binder implements IRemoteService {
        @Override
        public void sendMessage(String message) {
            // Handle the received message
            Log.d("RemoteService", "Received message: " + message);
        }
    }
}

```

 - AndroidManifest file in Application Server
```c
<!-- AndroidManifest.xml -->
<service
    android:name=".MyService"
    android:enabled="true"
    android:exported="true">
</service>
```

 - The client application implemetation :
```c
// MainActivity.java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private IRemoteService remoteService;
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        // Bind to the remote service
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, RemoteService.class);
        bindService(intent, serviceConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
        // Register a click listener for the button
        Button sendMessageButton = findViewById(R.id.sendMessageButton);
        sendMessageButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                sendMessageToRemoteService();
            }
        });
    }
    private ServiceConnection serviceConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
        @Override
        public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName componentName, IBinder iBinder) {
            remoteService = IRemoteService.Stub.asInterface(iBinder);
        }

        @Override
        public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName componentName) {
            remoteService = null;
        }
    };

    private void sendMessageToRemoteService() {
        if (remoteService != null) {
            try {
                remoteService.sendMessage("Hello from client!");
            } catch (RemoteException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } else {
            // Handle the case where the service is not connected
            Toast.makeText(this, "Service not connected", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }
}
```

## 2 Android Security Model Analysis

The Android Security Model serves as a strong defense, protecting user data, system integrity, and overall device security. It includes different layers of protection to address various threats. Let's explore specific threat models,security model and how Android enhances its security in this section.

- Threat Model:
   - Hacker can get physical access to Android devices.
   - Network communication is untrusted 
   - Untrusted code is executed on the device. (Device Image, bootloader, kernel, daemon, system server, app)
   - Privacy leakge for Mutiple party computationer experience.

- Security Model:
  - Multi-party consent: No action should be executed unless all main parties agree — in the standard case, these are user, platform, and developer.
  - Security is a compatibility requirement. Devices that do not conform to CDD and do not pass CTS,VTS are not Android compatiable devices. 
  - Factory reset restores the device to a safe state - returns a state that is covered by Verified Boot.
  - Applications are security principals - Applications is a basic elements in the security model.

- Security Model design
    Android's architecture is designed with multiple layers of security to provide a robust and comprehensive defense against various threats. The advantages of having multiple layers of security in Android include:
     - Defense in Depth:
Android employs a defense-in-depth strategy by implementing security measures at multiple layers. This means that if one layer is compromised, there are additional layers of protection to prevent further exploitation.
    - Comprehensive Protection:
Each security layer in Android addresses specific aspects of security, such as access control, data encryption, network security, and more. This comprehensive approach ensures that various attack vectors are covered.
    - Isolation of Components:
Different layers in Android are designed to operate independently and are isolated from each other.
    - Adaptability to Evolving Threats:
The capability to adjust to new security threats originates from the utilization of diverse security layers. These layers collaborate to provide a dynamic defense mechanism. As challenges evolve, Android can flexibly update its architecture, integrating additional security measures without disrupting the entire system.

Android's security architecture includes the following layers of protection:
- Android Compatibility Test: Ensures that Android devices meet compatibility standards, providing a consistent and secure user experience.
- Secure Bootloader and Integrity Verification: The bootloader ensures the integrity of the device's boot process. It verifies the authenticity and integrity of each component loaded during the boot sequence, preventing the execution of tampered or unauthorized code.
- SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux): Provides fine-grained access control to regulate interactions between processes and the Android system. SELinux enhances security by enforcing mandatory access controls and preventing unauthorized actions.
- Exploit Mitigation: Incorporates techniques like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to mitigate common exploit methods. These techniques make it more challenging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
- System Update: Regular updates are provided to patch vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of Android devices. These updates address known vulnerabilities and introduce new security features.
- Google Play:
   - Vetting Process: The Google Play Store reviews apps before they appear on Google Play to identify and remove potential threats.
   - Google Play Protect: Regular scans on devices to identify and remove harmful apps, enhancing overall security.
   - App Signing: Google Play manages app signing keys, improving the security of app updates.
   - SafetyNet API: Helps developers assess the security and compatibility of the Android devices their apps run on.
   - Security Metadata: Provides early detection of harmful apps before a full scan.
   - Timely Updates: Ensures quick deployment of security patches for installed apps.
  
- Authentication: Enforces strong authentication methods, including PINs, passwords, biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition), and device-based authentication.
- Multiple User Isolation: Supports multiple user profiles on a single device, ensuring isolation between user accounts. Each user has their own set of apps, settings, and data, enhancing privacy and security.
- App Isolation: Ensures that apps operate in isolated environments, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Each app runs independently, and its interactions with the system and other apps are restricted.
- Permission Framework: Apps request specific permissions to access certain device resources. Users can grant or deny these permissions, providing control over app capabilities and enhancing user privacy.
- TrustZone Root of Trust: TrustZone technology establishes a secure execution environment separate from the normal operating system. It enhances the security of critical functions and protects sensitive operations.
- File-Based Encryption (FBE): Devices using FBE offer two kinds of storage locations to apps:
   - Device Encrypted (DE) storage is available once the device boots, before the user unlocks thedevice. This storage is protected by a hardware secret and software running in the TEE that checks that Verified Boot is successful before decrypting data.
   - Credential Encrypted (CE) storage is available only after the user has unlocked the device. In addition to the protections on DE storage, CE storage keys can only be derived after unlocking the device, with protection against brute force attacks in hardware.

Google Private Computer Core also provide following mechanism:
- App Sandbox:  Apps operate within sandboxed environments, isolating them from apps outside of sanbox to protect user privacy when the app invloves mutiple party computation sucha as Federal AI or multiple party computuaion.

See the MediaCodec state diagram and sample code below to understand how to use the Media MediaCodec API.

<img src="mediacodecapi.png" alt="MediaReCodec API"/>

```c

public class MediaCodecExample {

    // Encoder configuration
    private static final String MIME_TYPE = "video/avc";
    private static final int WIDTH = 640;
    private static final int HEIGHT = 480;
    private static final int FRAME_RATE = 30;
    private static final int I_FRAME_INTERVAL = 5;
    private static final int BIT_RATE = 500000; // 500 kbps

    // Decoder configuration
    private static final int TIMEOUT_US = 10000;

    public void encodeDecodeVideo() {
        try {
            // Step 1: Create encoder and decoder instances
            MediaCodec encoder = createEncoder();

            // Step 2: Start encoder and decoder
            encoder.start();

            // Step 3: Feed input data to encoder
            FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/your/video/file");
            ByteBuffer[] inputBuffers = encoder.getInputBuffers();

            while (true) {
                int inputBufferIndex = encoder.dequeueInputBuffer(TIMEOUT_US);
                if (inputBufferIndex >= 0) {
                    ByteBuffer inputBuffer = inputBuffers[inputBufferIndex];
                    inputBuffer.clear();

                    // Read data from file to inputBuffer
                    int bytesRead = inputStream.read(inputBuffer.array());
                    if (bytesRead == -1) {
                        // End of file, signal end of input
                        encoder.queueInputBuffer(inputBufferIndex, 0, 0, 0, MediaCodec.BUFFER_FLAG_END_OF_STREAM);
                        break;  // Exit the loop when end of file is reached
                    } else {
                        // Queue input buffer for encoding
                        encoder.queueInputBuffer(inputBufferIndex, 0, bytesRead, 0, 0);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Rest of the code remains the same

            // Step 5: Stop and release resources
            encoder.stop();

## 4 Android Graphic framework
In this section, we will introduce the principles of the Android Graphic Framework, guide readers on monitoring and locating graphic issues, and provide solutions to resolve these issues. The goal is to empower readers to identify, locate, and effectively resolve rendering problems, ensuring a smoother and visually pleasing user experience.

### 4.1  The principal of Android Graphic Framework

The Android Graphics Framework is vital for crafting engaging visual experiences on Android devices. Its key components play a crucial role in rendering and managing graphical elements, utilizing the Surface class in Image Stream Producers for seamless interaction with SurfaceFlinger to efficiently render images. This involves features such as buffer queue reuse, collaboration with the Hardware Composer and synchronization with VSYNC for optimal performance and memory efficiency. See the main design diagram below about Android Graphic Framework:

<img src="graphic.png" alt="Android Graphic"/>

Key Components:

- Image stream producers: Components that create graphic buffers, such as the image stream in the Camera, WindowManagerService, MediaPlayer, and OpenGL ES, are referred to as image stream producers. They are closely connected with a surface, enabling efficient buffer handling.
- Rendering Tools:The Android Graphics Framework leverages rendering tools such as OpenGL ES, Skia, Vulkan, and Decoders to enhance the rendering capabilities. These tools contribute to the creation and manipulation of graphical content, further enriching the visual experience.
- Surface: The Surface is the image stream producer component that points to the graphic buffer queue. Created and managed by SurfaceFlinger, this buffer queue is a fundamental element in the interaction between image stream producers and SurfaceFlinger. It plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless handling of graphic buffers on the client side, contributing to the overall performance of the Android Graphics Framework.
- SurfaceFlinger: SurfaceFlinger is a crucial system service tasked with consuming currently visible surfaces and composing them onto the display. SurfaceFlinger utilizes OpenGL and the Hardware Composer to compose a collection of surfaces. Key features include::

   - Vsync Integration: SurfaceFlinger seamlessly incorporates Vsync (Vertical Synchronization) features, guaranteeing smooth and synchronized rendering. This integration involves coordination with the caller in the graphics pipeline and receive Vsync event from HW Cpmposer.

   - Enqueue/Dequeue Mechanism: SurfaceFlinger manages the queueing and dequeuing of surfaces in collaboration with its caller, ensuring smooth transitions and updates in graphical content

   - Collaboration with Hardware Composer(HW Composer): As an HW Composer stream producer, SurfaceFlinger shares composed buffers for HW Composer to consume.

- HW Composer: The HW Composer acts as the hardware abstraction for the display subsystem. It collaborates with SurfaceFlinger to offload certain composition work from OpenGL and the GPU, contributing to lower power consumption. Therefore, the stream composer could be either SurfaceFlinger or HW Composer. The HW Composer consumes the composed stream using a 2-buffer approach as outlined below:
  - Acquire a composed buffer from the stream composer for display.
  - Release a displayed buffer for the composer to inject the stream.
- Gralloc: Gralloc is responsible for allocating and managing graphics memory. These buffers are seamlessly interacted with by components such as Surface, SurfaceFlinger, and Hardware Composer, ensuring a cohesive and optimized visual experience on Android devices.


### 4.2  Analysis of Graphic Rendering Performance and Issues:

An example of the frame rendering process work flow is illustrated in the diagram below:

<img src="quality\graphicdropframe.png" alt="Rendering"/>

In the diagram, arrows represent refresh time, and the blocks represent frame time. The below is their rates definition:
 - **Refresh Rates:**
  Refresh rates refer to how often a display refreshes per second.
 - **Frame Rates:**
  Frame rate indicates how many frames are processed per second in the rendering process.

Different colors in the diagram represent the time spent by a rendering thread in each state in the diagram.  
- Green: Running state. The rendering thread is in the process to draw the frame.
- Blue: Runnable state. The thread is available to run but isn't currently scheduled.
- Gray: Lock block state. The thread is blocked on a mutex lock.
- Orange: I/O block state. The thread is blocked on I/O.
- Purple: STW block state. The thread is blocked by STW due to GC.
  
The numbers (1 and 2) in the diagram correspond to the actual frame numbers during processing. There could be multiple blocks shared with the same number. The sum of the time spent for the same number means the actual time spent processing a frame.

In the diagram, some frames have dropped because of different factors. This may cause screen tearing or stuttering, impacting the smoothness of animations or visual output:

- **Screen Tearing:**
  Screen tearing occurs when two different frames are displayed on the screen simultaneously, leading to a visible horizontal line or "tear" between them.

- **Stuttering:**
  Stuttering refers to motion being stuck during animations or video playback.

Fundamentally, stuttering and screen tearing occur due to the difference between frame rates and the refresh rate . The main causes are often related to the following factors:

- **Overdraw:**
  e.g., Excessive layering.

- **Memory Management:**
  e.g., Stop the world (STW) caused by GC and excessive memory allocation.

- **Thread Management:**
  e.g., Thread scheduling, I/O block, and lock block.

Therefore, we conclude that:
- Longer green color block indicates overdraw, possibly caused by many UI layers or time-consuming code in drawing.
- Longer purple color block suggests that your code is causing excessive memory allocation, potentially leading to Garbage Collection (GC).
- Longer gray color block implies that the rendering thread is blocked by a lock.
- Longer blue color block may indicate insufficient system resources, causing the rendering thread to wait for an extended period before execution.
- Longer orange color block suggests that the rendering thread has been blocked due to excessive Input/Output (IO) operations.

#### 4.3 Graphic Rendering Performance Monitoring:
In this secton,  we provide three approach to monitor Graphic Rendering Performance.

**Monitoring Tools**

To analyze frame rendering performance, we can leverage  [systrace](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing/) and [perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/). The diagram below, extracted from systrace, illustrates frame rendering:

<img src="quality\renderthread.png" alt="Frame Rendering"/>

- A red circle with 'f' inside indicates a dropped frame.
- A green circle with 'f' inside signifies a correctly drawn frame.
- The line between 'deliverInputEvent' and 'UI Thread' is color-coded based on the states introduced in section 2.1.2, representing different states of the render thread .


**Looper with custom logging**

Inspect the AOSP code snippet for Looper:
```c
public final class Looper {
    private Printer mLogging;
    // Used for customized Printer for logging
    public void setMessageLogging(@Nullable Printer printer) {
        mLogging = printer;
    }

    public static Looper getMainLooper() {
        ...
    }

    public static void loop() {
        final Looper me = myLooper();
   	...

        for (;;) {
            if (!loopOnce(me, ident, thresholdOverride)) {
                return;
            }
        }
    }

   private static boolean loopOnce(final Looper me,
            final long ident, final int thresholdOverride) {
        Message msg = me.mQueue.next(); // Specifically, each frame rendering involves receiving a message here
        ...
        final Printer logging = me.mLogging;
        if (logging != null) {
            logging.println(">>>>> Dispatching to " + msg.target + " "
                    + msg.callback + ": " + msg.what);
        }
        ...
        token = observer.messageDispatchStarting();
        ...

        if (logging != null) {
            logging.println("<<<<< Finished to " + msg.target + " " + msg.callback);
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
In this custom logging mechanism, each frame rendering results in a message being received.

As we can see, each frame rendering will cause me.mQueue.next() to receive a message. The information will be logged before and after the message is processed. This approach is utilized by monitoring tools like BlockCanary. Developing a custom logging mechanism allows us to incorporate various features, such as detecting frame drops during graphic rendering, capturing stack information when a frame is dropped, and measuring navigation time when a button is clicked. However, this solution has some limitations. It is primarily focused on UI rendering and also does not take print time cost into consideration.

**Choreographer#postFrameCallback**

Analyzing the Choreographer class reveals the following:

- postFrameCallback (Choreographer.FrameCallback callback): Posts a frame callback to run on the next frame. The callback runs once and is automatically removed.
- Choreographer.FrameCallback#doFrame(long frameTimeNanos): Called when a new display frame is being rendered, providing the time (in nanoseconds) when the frame started rendering.
- The difference between two consecutive frameTimeNanos values represents the time taken to render the previous frame.
We can utilize the following code snippet to monitor frame rendering:

```c
Choreographer.getInstance().postFrameCallback(new Choreographer.FrameCallback() {
    private long lastFrameTimeNanos = 0;
    @Override
    public void doFrame(long frameTimeNanos) {
        if (lastFrameTimeNanos == 0) {
            lastFrameTimeNanos = frameTimeNanos;
            Choreographer.getInstance().postFrameCallback(this);
            return;
        }
        double diff = (frameTimeNanos - lastFrameTimeNanos) / 1000000.0;
        if (diff > 16.67) {
            int dropCount = (int) (diff / 16.7);
            if (dropCount >= 2) {
                Log.w(TAG, dropCount + " frames have been dropped. Time difference: " + diff + " ms");

            }
        }
        lastFrameTimeNanos = frameTimeNanos;
        Choreographer.getInstance().postFrameCallback(this);
    }
});
```
This solution is also focused on UI rendering and does not take print time cost into consideration.

- SensorService: The SensorService is responsible for bridging applications with the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Using the poll() mechanism and the UDB-based BitTube protocol, it employs a Threadloop to receive sensor events from the HAL layer.
- HAL API and  sensors.h: The API is the interface between the hardware drivers and the Android framework. It consists of one HAL interface sensors.h and one HAL implementation we refer to as sensors.cpp. The interface is defined by Android and AOSP contributors, and the implementation is provided by the manufacturer of the device.
- Driver: The sensor drivers interact with the physical devices. In some cases, the HAL implementation and the drivers are the same software entity. In other cases, the hardware integrator requests sensor chip manufacturers to provide the drivers, but they are the ones writing the HAL implementation. In all cases, HAL implementation and kernel drivers are the responsibility of the hardware manufacturers, and Android does not provide preferred approaches to write them.

The sample code below uses the listed API to get accelerometer's (x, y ,z) Axis.

```c
import android.content.Context;
import android.hardware.Sensor;
import android.hardware.SensorEvent;
import android.hardware.SensorEventListener;
import android.hardware.SensorManager;
import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class SensorActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements SensorEventListener {

    private SensorManager sensorManager;
    private Sensor accelerometerSensor;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_sensor);

        // Initialize SensorManager
        sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);

        // Get the default accelerometer sensor
        accelerometerSensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);

        // Check if the accelerometer sensor is available
        if (accelerometerSensor != null) {
            // Register the SensorEventListener
            sensorManager.registerListener(this, accelerometerSensor, SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event) {
        if (event.sensor.getType() == Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER) {
            // Access accelerometer values represented by xAxis, yAxis, and zAxis
            float[] accelerometerValues = event.values;
            float xAxis = accelerometerValues[0];
            float yAxis = accelerometerValues[1];
            float zAxis = accelerometerValues[2];

            // TODO: Use accelerometer data in your application logic
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onAccuracyChanged(Sensor sensor, int accuracy) {
        // Handle accuracy changes if needed
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        // Unregister the SensorEventListener to conserve resources when the activity is paused
        sensorManager.unregisterListener(this);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        // Re-register the SensorEventListener when the activity is resumed
        if (accelerometerSensor != null) {
            sensorManager.registerListener(this, accelerometerSensor, SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL);
        }
    }
}

```
