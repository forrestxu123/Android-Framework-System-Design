##Android Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
IPC mechanisms that involves communication of one process with another process. In Linux, various IPC mechanisms are available, including Pipes, FIFO, Message Queues, Unix Sockets, Shared Memory, Semaphores, 
and Signals. These mechanisms offer valuable means of communication, they come with certain limitations:
- Functionality:
    The listed IPC mechanisms are primarily designed for local communication between processes on the same machine. However, they are not specialized for remote method calls and Object-Oriented Communication.
- Security:
    Fine-Grained Security Controls: The listed IPC mechanisms lack fine-grained security controls, making it challenging to regulate access to shared resources.
Access Regulation: They may not provide effective mechanisms to regulate which processes can access shared resources, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
Permissions Management: The listed IPC mechanisms may not manage permissions effectively, raising concerns about data security and unauthorized access.
Security issues may lead to data leakage or deadlock, especially when using semaphore mechanisms. For preinstalled apps or daemons, a viable solution is to utilize SELinux, ensuring that specific apps can access designated IPC mechanisms, safeguarding app data. However, for regular apps running in an untrusted app domain, SELinux may face limitations in distinguishing between them.
To address these challenges, the Android system provides the Binder IPC mechanism. We will introduce widely used IPC mechanisms in Android, including Unix Sockets, Shared Memory, and Binder IPC.
### SharedMemory
    Shared memory facilitates fast and efficient communication between processes, enabling direct data sharing without the overhead of copying. It provides low-latency, high-performance communication, making it suitable for scenarios involving frequent and large data transfers. The memory-mapped nature of shared memory simplifies data manipulation and enhances memory efficiency, allowing processes to access shared data as if it were regular memory. To ensure proper concurrency and avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory, synchronization mechanisms like semaphores are required. 
#### Shared Memory example code
See example code for creating shared memory, accesimg memory and semaphores based synchronization mechanisms below:
Program A
```c
int main() {
    size_t size = sizeof(int);
    const char *filename = "/tmp/shared_memory_example";
    const char *writeSemaphoreName = "/shared_write_semaphore_example";
    // Open the existing file
    int fd = open(filename, O_RDWR);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Map the file into memory
    int *data = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    if (data == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Open the existing write semaphore
    sem_t *writeSem = sem_open(writeSemaphoreName, 0);
    if (writeSem == SEM_FAILED) {
        perror("sem_open");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Write to shared memory
    sem_wait(writeSem);  // Wait for write semaphore
    *data =100;
    printf("Write Process wrote to shared memory: %d\n", *data);
    sem_post(writeSem);  // Release write semaphore

    // Cleanup
    sem_close(writeSem);
    munmap(data, size);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
Program B
```c
int main() {
    size_t size = sizeof(int);
    const char *filename = "/tmp/shared_memory_example";
    const char *readSemaphoreName = "/shared_read_semaphore_example";
    // Open the existing file
    int fd = open(filename, O_RDWR);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Map the file into memory
    int *data = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    if (data == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Open the existing read semaphore
    sem_t *readSem = sem_open(readSemaphoreName, 0);
    if (readSem == SEM_FAILED) {
        perror("sem_open");
        exit(1);
    }
    // Read from shared memory
    sem_wait(readSem);  // Wait for read semaphore
    printf("Read Process read from shared memory: %d\n", *data);
    sem_post(readSem);  // Release read semaphore
    // Cleanup
    sem_close(readSem);
    munmap(data, size);
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
```c
In this example, Program A writes to shared memory, and Program B reads from shared memory. Both programs use semaphores for synchronization.
